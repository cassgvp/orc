Job: Research Fellow
Affiliation: School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom
ShortBio: I received my undergraduate degree in medicine (MD) and my PhD in clinical
  neuroscience from the University of Pécs, Hungary, where I implemented various neuroimaging
  techniques in a clinical environment. My first post-doc project at the Biomedizinische
  NMR Forschungs GmbH in Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen
  focused on real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback with special emphasis on the implementation
  and the optimization of the experimental setup and the analysis. My main current
  project is on optimising neuromodulation approaches, such as tACS based on real-time
  neural signals, and I also collaborate in other real-time fMRI and neurofeedback
  projects. I also work on how to improve the temporal resolution and reliability
  of fMRI-based neurofeedback, and co-develop OpenNFT, a Python/Matlab framework for
  real-time fMRI neurofeedback and automatic analysis, a Matlab framework to process
  multimodal neuroimaging analysis pipelines. I am also a strong supporter of transparency
  and replicability of neuroimaging approaches, and I am involved in international
  initiatives such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure and Neuroimaging Data Model
  providing a standard of organising neuroimaging data."
