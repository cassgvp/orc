ShortBio: Dr Tijl Grootswagers is a computational cognitive neuroscientist who combines
  machine learning techniques, neuroimaging, and behavioural data to understand how
  the brain represents and processes information. More specifically, he investigates
  how the brain perceives and represents visual objects, and how it uses these representations
  for decision making. He flexibly uses various neuroimaging techniques, such as functional
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine representations in different brain
  areas, or magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to study
  the temporal dynamics of information processing.
