ShortBio: My PhD focused on the neural mechanisms of attention and prediction in visual
  awareness, using computational modelling and multivariate analyses of human brain
  imaging data (EEG and MEG) to investigate how predictions bias attention and visual
  awareness. I'm also passionate about using the principles of Open Science to create
  a fair and efficient system of scholarly communication. To help achieve this, I
  founded Project Free Our Knowledge.
