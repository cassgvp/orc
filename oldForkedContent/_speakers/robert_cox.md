Name: Robert Cox
Title:
Pronouns: He/Him
Job: Core Director
Affiliation: NIMH, Bethesda Maryland, USA
ShortBio: Long ago, Robert fell in love, moved to be with his new wife, and had to
  find a new job. Somehow he ended up doing FMRI, and then AFNI sprang into being.
  He didn't intend this to happen, but AFNI has taken over his career (in a good way,
  mostly), so here we are.
