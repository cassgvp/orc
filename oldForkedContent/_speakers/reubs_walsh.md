Title: Ms
Pronouns: They/them or She/her
Job: PhD Candidate
Affiliation: Faculty of Behaviour and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam
ShortBio: My PhD is in the role of the social environment and social-cognitive development
  in mental health risk in adolescents. Next year I will take up a postdoctoral position
  at the Einstein lab in the University of Toronto, where I will investigate the contributions
  of various biological and biopsychosocial processes related to sex and/or gender
  to the healthy ageing of brains, using a gender-diverse sample and a mixture of
  qualitative, behavioural, biomedical and (principally) multimodal neuroimaging methods
  to begin to disentangle these effects. We hope to be able to shed some light on
  the role of social and biological correlates of gender in cognitive ageing and dementia,
  as well as emotional brain-health in older adults, and opportunities for improvements
  in trans-specific healthcare, especially in older adults
