ShortBio: Professor Linda Larson-Prior is interested in better understanding the dynamic
  neural network reconfigurations that occur as the brain changes state, both under
  normal conditions such as sleep, and in pathological shifts in cognitive awareness.
  At present, one major research thrust is in Parkinson's disease, where hallmark
  features include motor, autonomic and cognitive domains. In that context, she is
  working with a multi-disciplinary team to acquire data unbiased by access to their
  tertiary care medical center and it is one thrust of that effort that she plans
  to discuss in this talk.
